ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brettchyyy. I'm an undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in bioengineering. I joined the Systems Neuroscience and Pain Lab in the summer of '23
where I worked with Dr. Kenneth Weber to develop a force-matching task. This task will be used in a clinical experiment which seeks to better understand the mechanisms of 
degenerative cerival myelopathy, while also determining methods to better predict surigcal outcomes for these patients.
